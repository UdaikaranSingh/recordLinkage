- For Checkpoint 2:
	- All members - performed EDA
	- Udai: Performed EDA on smaller datasets & transformed in graphs.
	- Shinu: Cleaned and performed EDA on datasets
	- Wesley: Created Baselines for future model testing

### Revision to the Proposal

...**Shinu**

### Backlog:

- For Checkpoint 1:
	- All members - revised proposal
	- Udai: Create code for generating datasets with strong keys (and varying noise)
	- Shinu: Clean and perform EDA on our real-world datasets
	- Wesley: Finalize Structure of our Heterogenous Graphs
		- determine method for representing graphs (on disk)
		- determine method for using quantitative attributes.

- For Checkpoint 2:
	- Generate Heterogenous Graphs (Udai)
	- Train baselines Models (Wesley)
		- perform tests over a subset of generated datasets
	- Clean real dataset and transform in a usable format (Shinu)
	- Stretch Goal: Train/Evaluate Hindroid Model using our data (everyone)
